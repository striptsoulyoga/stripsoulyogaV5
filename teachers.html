            <p class="mb-0">While attending graduate school in Baltimore, MD, Tangi discovered her love for yoga. It was the way that yoga
              made her feel physically, mentally, and spiritually, allowing her to have a more balanced and peaceful outlook
              on life. After graduation, this Mississippi girl moved to L.A. and continued to develop her practice. Wanting
              to learn and understand yoga more, Tangi enrolled into the Tamal Yoga School and received her Yoga Alliance
              Certification. During her teacher training program, Tangi found a desire to share her knowledge and made the
              decision to start teaching.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">Tangi believes that yoga is a personal journey for each and every person, and focuses on that as a cornerstone
              of how she presents herself when teaching. Her classes are designed to be faster-paced, sweaty, fluid, and
              alignment-focused. She is excited to bring Stript Soul Yoga to the community and to share her passion for yoga
              with her students.</p>

              decided to do something that would change her life forever. Angela completed her 200 hr training at one of
              her favorite yoga studios, Yoga Salt, with the incredible Tamal Dodge. In addition to teaching yoga, Angela
              has a BFA in theatre and in the last 5 years began puppeteering. Angela created a children's show called the
              Mindful Monster where she incorporates yoga to help teach children mindfulness. She believes in the healing
              power of yoga and mindfulness, they go hand and hand. Angela hopes you leave her class feeling grounded, focused,
              strong, and with a bit more self-compassion for yourself on and off the mat. </p>

              grace and an outlet for stress and her restless energy. Allyson has completed her 200-hour RYT under world
              renowned Yoga Teacher and Yoga Salt owner Tamal Dodge, deepening her understanding and appreciation for the

            <p class="mb-0">Jenny Kim grew up in Denver, CO and stepped into her first yoga class when she was 17. It was the first thing
              she'd ever pursued as a young adult by herself, for herself, for no other reason than feeling drawn to it.
              She immediately fell in love the the practice - the challenge, the growth, the connection between soul and
              body. She cultivated a consistent yoga practice, moved to Los Angeles, and worked in yoga studios and wellness
              programs while attending undergraduate and graduate school at USC. She graduated from Tamal Dodge's 200 hour
              yoga teacher training in the Spring of 2018. Jenny Kim's classes are challenging, playful, and dynamic. During
              the week, Jenny enjoys working as an Occupational Therapist specializing in Hand Therapy. The yoga mat sets
              her free.</p>

            <p class="mb-0">Growing up in San Francisco, Marian is a California native. She has played competitive sports her whole life, but
              never found a physical activity she truly fell in love with. While living in the Bay Area, she was always hesitant
              to try yoga as she did not consider herself flexible and felt she did not have the "right" body for the practice.
              However, after she moved to Los Angeles for graduate school at LMU, she discovered yoga and fell in love immediately.
              She quickly learned yoga was for all people, no matter what their body type or level of flexibility. She completed
              her 200 hour teacher training with Tamal Dodge in the spring of 2018 and has been teaching ever since. For Marian,
              teaching yoga has been an honor and a gift. She hopes to help others, both physically and mentally, through her
              vinyasa style yoga classes. She encourages anyone and everyone to try her yoga classes, no matter what their
              experience with yoga is!</p>
